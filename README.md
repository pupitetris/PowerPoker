# PowerPoker

Place the cards on the 5x5 board and make as many points as you can
from the resulting [Poker
hands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands), both
top-down and across. That's it!

This game is inspired on COMPUTE!'s Gazette 1985/11 (Issue 29) Power
Poker game, coded in C64 BASIC by [Jud
Bleser](https://bleser.com/jud/jud.html). This implementation is
